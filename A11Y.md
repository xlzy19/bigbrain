1. Alt Text for Images
Implemented in GameCard.jsx, inside the GameCard component.
All game thumbnails include meaningful alt attributes to support screen reader users.

2. Tooltips for Icon-Only Buttons
Implemented in GameCard.jsx (GameCard component)

Also used in SessionStartedModal.jsx (SessionStartedModal component)
Buttons such as “Copy”, “Stop”, and “View” use tooltips to provide descriptive labels for non-visual users.

3. High Contrast Text and Backgrounds
Applied globally in index.css.
Custom color variables and Ant Design’s color tokens are used to ensure readable contrast between text and background.

4. Keyboard Navigation and Modal Focus
Enabled through Ant Design modals and native elements in:

NewGameModal.jsx (NewGameModal component)

SessionStartedModal.jsx (SessionStartedModal component)

Login.jsx, Register.jsx (form components)
All interactive elements are keyboard accessible; modals trap focus while open and restore it on close.

5. Clear Heading Structure and Text Hierarchy
Structured using layout components in:

AdminResults.jsx (AdminResults component)

PlayerResults.jsx (PlayerResults component)

SessionStartedModal.jsx (SessionStartedModal component)
Proper use of headings and sections improves navigation for assistive technologies.

6. Responsive and Zoom-Compatible Layout
Handled in index.css using media queries and flexible units.
The interface adapts well to different screen sizes and remains usable when zoomed in up to 200%.
