1. Usability & Navigation Enhancements
Consistent layout structure: All pages follow a unified layout pattern using Ant Design components such as Card, Layout, and PageHeader, which improves readability and user familiarity.

Clear navigation entry points: In the Dashboard, key actions like “Edit”, “Start”, “View”, and “Delete” are clearly labeled with both icons and tooltips, helping users understand functionality at a glance.

Breadcrumb navigation: The GameEdit page uses breadcrumbs to indicate hierarchy and help users understand their current location in the app.

2. Visual Feedback & Interactive Cues
Loading and action feedback: Form submissions show loading states (loading={true}), and actions display feedback via message.success or message.error for better user awareness.

Countdown animation: The CountdownTimer component uses conic-gradient to show live progress, increasing engagement and clarity during timed questions.

Answer feedback: After a question is answered, answers are visually marked with ✓ or ✗, and styled in green/red to clearly indicate correctness.

3. Input Constraints & Error Prevention
Form validation: All inputs (email, password, game name, question text) include required rules, email format checks, and length restrictions to prevent invalid submissions.

Confirmation for destructive actions: Deleting games or questions triggers a Popconfirm modal to prevent accidental data loss.

Answer option limits: While creating a game, the number of answer options is restricted (minimum 2, maximum 6) to ensure clarity and usability.

4. Responsive Design for Device Compatibility
Mobile-friendly layouts: Media queries (@media) are applied in index.css to adapt spacing, font sizes, and layout paddings for mobile and tablet devices.

Adaptive button layout: Buttons within components like GameCard use Space and flex layouts to automatically wrap on smaller screens.

5. Visual Consistency & Information Hierarchy
Color theme and spacing: Global CSS variables (e.g., --primary-color, --error-color) ensure a consistent theme across buttons, alerts, and borders.

Clear grouping of content: Divider, Title, and Tag components are used to separate and organize content logically (e.g., results, question metadata).

Modular component design: UI elements like GameCard, QuestionView, and SessionStartedModal are encapsulated, reusable, and styled consistently.

6. Learnability & First-Time User Support
Beginner-friendly interactions: In the PlayJoin page, the session ID is pre-filled (if available), and the “Copy Link” button provides tooltip feedback and visual confirmation.

Placeholders and contextual help: Almost all input fields include placeholder text and hints (e.g., “Enter your password”) to help new users complete forms without confusion.
